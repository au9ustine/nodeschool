# Issues

## Description

Due to unknown reason the test cannot be passed even reusing [the _answer_ code][1] provided by the authors. The root cause is unknown and no extra time for me would be on performing an RCA to this issue. 

Anyway I would like to express appreciation for the efforts of the authors of this course. Hopefully they could improve the quality of this course in the future.

[A further issue discussion][2] can be found on Github.
